# CatBoot
Simple, yet beautiful bootloader for Open Computers
## Building
- Download all the script from the repository to your computer running OpenOS
- Install `crunch` from OPPM
- Optional: Run `drawclude` if you want to include logo and image rendering
- Run `crunch eeprom.lua` or `crunch eeprom.dr.lua` if you've ran `drawclude`
- Flash `eeprom.cr.lua` or `eeprom.dr.cr.lua` if you've ran `drawclude`.
